This folder contains the smallest combination of the (3_1). I replaced the numbers to be single precision flopoco instead of double precision flopoco. 
The weights, input stream and output stream are converted to 34 bits instead of 66 bits
The design fits on the FPGA DE10 Standard.
The input stream is read from a ROM.
The output stream is read via Quartus Signal Tap
The values are correct.
