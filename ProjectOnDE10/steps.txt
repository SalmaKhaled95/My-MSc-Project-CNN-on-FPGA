pin planner (Output on GPIO, clk) 
compile

PROGRAM DEVICE (Put a second square (device))


signal tap (Choose the clock on the right and the output signals on the left)
compile
PROGRAM DEVICE (delete the second device and insert again)

make sure to choose the second square at the data tab of signal tap, and the clock constraint is slow clock and pre synthesis in signal tap and jtag clock is 6 not 24
